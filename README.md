# song_sentiment_analyzer

This repo will take songs and pass them to Google's Natural Language API. 

1. It will first parse the song, line by line (lyrics.txt)
2. Return Score from API (Sentiment Score, Magnitude) and store 
3. Average all scores and all magnitudes, then multiply to return average score

Pretty simple right? 

## All you need to do...
Change the configuration file to include your API key :) 

## Usage
`python main.py`
